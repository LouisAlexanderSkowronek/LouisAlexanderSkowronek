Hi, Iâ€™m Louis!
I am a passionate programmer in several programming languages since I was 10 years old in 2015. I started learning it by books and several online ressources
and strongly improved since then. On this profile I regularily upload some projects I made, feel free to use or review them.

If you have any questions, feature suggestions, bugs, fixes, or other improvement ideas, feel free to contact me via email at louis.alexander.skowronek@gmail.com

Have a nice day :)
