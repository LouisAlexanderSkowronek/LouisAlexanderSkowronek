Hi, Iâ€™m Louis!
I am a passionate programmer in several programming languages. I started learning it by books and several online ressources in 2015. On this profile I regularily upload some projects I made since then. As they all are open-source, you can of course use and review them.

If you have any questions, feature suggestions, bugs, fixes, or general improvement ideas, feel free to contact me via email at louis.alexander.skowronek@gmail.com

Have a nice day :)
