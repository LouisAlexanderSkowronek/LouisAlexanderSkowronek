Hi, Iâ€™m Louis!
I am a passionate programmer in several programming languages. I started learning it from books and several online ressources in 2015. On this profile I regularily upload some projects I made since then. As they all are open-source, you can of course freely use and review them.
If you use and publish something using my projects (for example by using a texture), I'd still like to get to know that and to be mentioned in the credits.

If you have any questions or ideas, feel free to contact me via email at louis.alexander.skowronek@gmail.com

Have a nice day :)
